# Research Experience
2016–2017 Research Assistant at Brno university of technology.
          Babel Project: Funded by IARPA
          Analysis of real-world recorded speech from various languages. Developed robust and efficient acoustic
          modeling method and played an active role in performance improvement of the existing systems.
2017–present LORELEI Project: Funded by DARPA
          Developing a low cost speech recognition system for zero/low resource languages using Bayesian methods
          and WFST techniques. Direct pipeline from speech to text by extracting unsupervised acoustic units and
          mapping it to their corresponding phonemes followed by word segmentation.
2010–2012 Research Associate at IIT Madras.
          Member of the team working on building robust Indian Language speech recognizer Integrating telephone
          and speech recognizer using Asterisk software and Sphinx on Linux based operating system/
2009-2010 Web Researcher at Mobius Technologies.
